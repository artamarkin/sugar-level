# Into
Investigation project of how different types of food affect glucose level in blood. To perform this experiment I installed glucose [level sensor](https://www.freestylelibre.nl/) into my arm for two weeks. The sensor record glucose level each 15 min automatically. You can also trigger the check manually to have more precise results. For my experiment I manually recorded all kind of food I consumed to then estimate an effect of this food. I did the analysis in the python notebook and combined all the result in the presentation.

# Requirements
- To install requirements please do compile them first:
```
pip-compile requirements.in
```
- The you can use:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Experiment Result
Experiment results can be found in `Sugar-Level-Results.pdf`. The notebook with aggregation and computations is `[1]-EDA.ipynb`

# Future Steps
Amount of data I collected was quite limited to make any final conclusions. In the future I would like to use the sensors again to extract additional 1-2 months of data to get more concrete results.
